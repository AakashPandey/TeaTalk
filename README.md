# TeaTalk
version 0.9
-----------

Tea-Talk is a tool for texting an other computer on the same network(Wi-Fi).

I created it becuase one day I wanted to share a web-page link with my room mate
by just using the terminal.

Installation : 

<*> In Terminal cd to /exec folder and run TeaInstaller
 
    sample code: 
        
        cd Downloads/TeaTalk/exec
            ./Teainstaller

Uninstallation :

<*> 
    Remove .TeaTalk directory from your /home/user

<*> Delete the last line from your .bashrc
    
    sample line:
        
        alias teatalk='/home/user/.TeaTalk/./Tealaunch'
